# Ecosystems

Blockchain Ecosystem Registry is an open-source database that can be freely accessed by people in or outside the world of blockchain technology. We want the data, to be transparent, and verified by the community. Offering real insights into this emerging technology. 

We want to achieve this goal through, collaboration, and participation. The registry is open for everyone to make contributions, verify, ask questions, and engage in discussions.

The definition of an ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment, interacting as a system. 

Blockchain ecosystems are defined by the core blockchain. We find it essential to look at blockchain ecosystems since it gives strong indications of network effects and the trajectory of a given ecosystem. To view ecosystems as a whole it is important to include projects both with and without tokens.

We are offering all ecosystems a fair chance to prove their relevance. Making it easy to compare the ecosystems emerging, recently launched, as well as the more established and understanding what is going on within a specific ecosystem.

A registry like this is only useful if the data it provides can be consumed by machines and humans alike. On the other hand it is only accesible to broad communities if the technical barrier for contributing is not too steep. To meet this requirement we have chosen a data format that is read- and writeable by both machines and humans, namely [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML). All our templates have inline explanations to make it easier for anyone to add projects even with zero coding knowledge.

To further support the process of bringing this registry into actual applications we will initiate the work to build an open [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) and [SDKs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit) for various languages and frameworks.

We've started out with only one ecosystem but we strongly encourage everyone to contribute and help build the registry by adding new ecosystems and projects. Please consult the [docs](/CONTRIBUTE.md) for further information on how to contribute to this project.
