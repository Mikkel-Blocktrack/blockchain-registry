# Ethereum Ecosystem Registry

Blockchain Ecosystem Registry is an open-source database that can be freely accessed by people in or outside the world of blockchain technology. We want the data, to be transparent, and verified by the community. Offering real insights into this emerging technology.

Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. On Ethereum, you can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and is accessible anywhere in the world.

**Project example**

 For more correct project upload you can see a project example [HERE](https://gitlab.com/blcktrck/bt-registry/-/blob/master/projects/augur.yaml).

**Registry language**

 The registry is written in YAML. The templates has explenations so everybody can add a project even with zero coding knowledge. YAML (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. [READ MORE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
