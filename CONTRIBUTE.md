This registry is open for all ecosystems and communities with a relevance to the blockchain space - feel free to add yours. Here is a quick walkthrough on how to do that.

_Important info about the registry governance:  It is our ambition to introduce fully decentralised governance down the line, but for now a group of moderators will audit the information committed to this repo. The moderators vow to purely focus on the quality of the information in the submissions and not subjective opinions on individual projects._

First of all you have to find out if you want to add a new ecosystem or you want to add a project to an existing one.

**If you want to add a project to an exisitng ecosystem**

All you have to do is locate the project template file in the correct ecosystem folder. Copy the template yaml file and fill out the project details.

**If you want to add a new ecosystem (core blockchain)**

Locate the ecosystem template folder and copy the template folder and fill out the README.me file and the two yaml files. Now you're ready to add projects to the ecosystem.

**If you feel categories, tags or other relevant taxonomies are missing for your project**

Go to the [taxonomies folder](taxonomies) to read more.
