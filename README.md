# The Blockchain Ecosystem Registry

The Blockchain Ecosystem Registry is an open-source index that can be freely accessed by people in or outside the world of blockchain technology. We want the information in the registry to be verified by the community in order to offer real insights into the emerging decentralized web technologies.

We want to achieve this goal through collaboration and participation. The registry is open for anyone to make contributions, verify information, ask questions and engage in discussions.

Visit the [ecosystems](/ecosystems) folder to learn more on how to contribute and use this registry.

# Taxonomies
Categorization of and relations between projects are handled by taxonomies that live in the taxonmies folder. Right now two taxonomies are in use, namely `categories` and `tags`.

Check the documentation in the [taxonomies folder](/taxonomies) for further information.
